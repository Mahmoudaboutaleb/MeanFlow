## Usage

To use **MeanFlow**, follow these simple steps:

1. Import the necessary modules in your Python script:
   ```python
   import torch
   from mean_flow import MeanFlowModel
   ```

2. Initialize the model:
   ```python
   model = MeanFlowModel()
   ```

3. Train the model with your dataset:

   ```python
   samples = model.generate(num_samples=100)
   ```

5. For detailed examples, refer to the [examples](examples/) directory.

## Model Architecture

The **MeanFlow** model is based on a flow-based architecture that allows for efficient sampling and density estimation. The key components include:

- **Flow Layers**: These layers transform simple distributions into complex ones.
- **Mean Calculation**: The model calculates the mean flow to enhance generation quality.
- **Diffusion Process**: Integrates diffusion models to refine the output.

## Training

To train the model effectively:

1. Prepare your dataset. Ensure it is in the correct format.
2. Set hyperparameters in the `config.py` file.
3. Run the training script:
   ```bash
   python train.py --config config.py
   ```

4. Monitor the training process. You can visualize the loss and generated samples.

For more detailed training instructions, check the [Training Guide](docs/training_guide.md).

## Evaluation

Evaluating the model is crucial for understanding its performance. To evaluate the trained model:

1. Load the trained model:
   ```python
   model.load('path_to_trained_model.pth')
   ```

2. Use evaluation metrics such as Inception Score (IS) or FrÃ©chet Inception Distance (FID) to assess the quality of generated samples.

3. Generate and visualize samples:
   ```python
   samples = model.generate(num_samples=100)
   visualize(samples)
   ```
